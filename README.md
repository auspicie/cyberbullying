Predicting Types of Cyberbullying from Tweets
==============================

Summary

This project aims to build a predictive model by comparing accuracy of a machine learning model (random forest), deep learning algorithms (CNN, LSTM and Pretrained Transformer) to categorize tweets into cyber bullying classes and  non-cyberbullying classes. 

Steps to Reproducing the Project

Create a google account.

Navigate to google drive and create a folder named `NLP`.

Download data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/cyberbullying-classification) and save it in the newly created folder `NLP`.

Navigate to `Runtime>Change runtime type>` select GPU as the hardware accelerator


Install the list of packages used to create the project by running the code below on a cell in colab. The `requirements.txt` file can be found here : [link](https://github.com/thayeylolu/cyberbullying/blob/main/requirements.txt).
```python
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
